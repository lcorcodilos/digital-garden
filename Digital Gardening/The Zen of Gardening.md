This is my garden.

You're standing in it right now, looking around, observing curated corners, wild vines, bright overgrown wild flowers, and freshly mulched beds; a reflection pool, a ragged hedge maze, a pavement path with weeds between the stones leading to an aging bench with a polished plaque.

This is not a place to make things perfect or to show to the world; or to make a mess or to be alone. It is a place to slow time and be intentionally attentive to my thoughts; to introduce calm by removing structure, and to use the calm to support creative thoughts; to observe those thoughts; to practice. The garden is the result and the gardening is the practice. I'm not here for the garden, I'm here for the gardening.

I share the garden with others and invite them to garden with me. Gardening together doesn't mean working separately in nearby plots of land. That would just be two people tending to their own gardens. Instead, we engage together on the same project. And if my friend plants daisies among my strawberries, I don't rip them out or try to convince them, "This bed is for berries only!" I work to understand more than just what exists in my own view - "I've never thought of daisies among berries. Tell me about your vision so I can see it too." My garden is better for it.

Some days I want to revisit a tree that was planted long ago and just observe. On others, I visit the neighboring bush, planted around the same time, to trim and shape in the way that suits me on that day.

Today, I plant pumpkin seeds with no expectations; maybe they'll only grow into vines or maybe nothing at all. I enjoy the vision of jack-o-latterns in the fall, as bright during the day as they are at night.

As I take the time to pick a bed of land, prepare the soil, and plant the seeds, I note the dryness of the dirt under my finger nails and my mind wanders to building an irrigation system. I can't build it today. I don't have time and that's okay. But I pause, take out a notebook and pencil and scribble a note for later, smeared dirt on the page a reminder of when I had the thought.

Why does my mind wander to an irrigation system? I like to build tools, especially ones that make my work easier. Does that mean I'm frustrated by the watering can? Why is the watering can insufficient? Doesn't it help me to slow down?

It does - but I hate having to do the same walk over and over again between the plants. To some, it might be a meditative ritual but to me, the monotony is not how I like to spend my time there. The soil is dry because I avoid this task and guilt built from the thirsting plants causes me to skip some trips to the garden, afraid to see wilting leaves.

The destructive cycle is clear. I don't use the watering can because of my own biases and I don't build the irrigation system because of the cost. I get disappointed when the garden suffers so I avoid the garden and it suffers more. I haven't decided whether I should force myself to use the watering can or make time for the irrigation system or accept the cost of the wilting; but I now see why I've started spending less time here.

As I pour the seeds from the package to my hand, this one falls out with them: I create these cycles outside of the garden too.

As I plant the pumpkin seed for the garden, I plant this seed for the gardener; a meditation that will leave with me, possible only because today I decided to try planting pumpkins.
