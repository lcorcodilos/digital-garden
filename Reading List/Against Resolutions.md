Suleika's words here are so cutting yet so kind. 

> I believed, naively, that I could simply decide _I’m going to do this_ and that would be enough.
> ...
> I had resolved to do it, therefore it was to be.
> ...
> confusing declaration with destiny
> ...
> I look back now on the whole ordeal as comically doomed from the start. At the time, it felt intimate—not just a failed resolution, but an indictment of my capacity for change. For a brief moment, the plan had lifted me out of myself. I had something to train for, something that made the future feel legible again. When it collapsed almost immediately, it didn’t just knock me back to where I’d started. It confirmed my worst fear: that wanting change was itself a liability, another way to set myself up for disappointment.
> 
> Eventually, I stopped making resolutions altogether. Not because I stopped wanting change—but because I stopped trying to become someone else. The desire to work on myself never went away. It simply lost its appetite for spectacle. And so, in place of resolutions, I turned toward ritual.
> ...
> Rather than control, rituals are relational. They create atmosphere. They offer rhythm and containment. Where resolutions depend on willpower—a finite resource, especially in times of illness or uncertainty—rituals build scaffolding. They don’t ask us to muscle through. They anchor us in time, place, and meaning. Rituals are not impressive.
> ...
> They steady us. They open us up to possibility without demanding performance. They keep us from the all-or-nothing thinking—from what Michael Bierut described as the sensation of walking a tightrope, peril increasing with each step until you freeze, convinced you’ll never make it across.
> 
> That’s what ritual gives me now. Not a guarantee, not an outcome, not a transformation on a deadline, but a means of staying in motion without hardening, to keep my balance without gripping so tightly.

I recently started a habit-building effort. I got a big vertical whiteboard on wheels and Post-Its of multiple colors and started trying to organize all of my medium-term ambitions: software-based projects, learning goals, reading goals, chores, exercise routines, journaling, meditating.

I got everything in my head up on the board, organized, designed a system for tracking and scheduling progress, and even built a point system with a monetary reward for progress each week. Each task gets assigned points that are determined ad-hoc; roughly based on time (about 1 point per 15 minutes of estimated focus time) with room to add more points if I really don't want to do it.

I target earning 25 points each week. At the end of each week, the points are converted to a bank for me to "save them". Every point over 25, I get to keep. Every point below 25 and I pay a hefty penalty, computing the banked points as `e ^ (pts / 7.75)`. At `pts = 25`, the equation rounds to 25 so it's roughly continuous. But being at 24 points (1 point short of the goal), converts to 22 points -- so I lose 3 instead of 1 before banking!

"So clever"

And yet, here I am. Last week I did 7 points (before taking the exponential penalty). I saw the number and thought, "It was Christmas and I was away so I'm giving myself some grace and doing a two week period instead." Where am I on Wednesday of the 2nd week? 11 points...

And let's not mention the "long-term" goals, partitioned into a separate month-scale bucket. I wanted to complete *The Mythical Man-Month* essays by end of November. I missed that so I extended it to... *looks at calendar*... today. Let's just say, I'm going to miss that goal again.

I am currently earning points for writing this though. "1pt / 30 min of reading or writing" is what the board says. Between this reflection and some other notes, I've been going for more than 2 hours (with a couple short breaks).

I'm proud of the ~5 points I expect to add (quantifying the work done is motivating!) because I could have spent the day playing video games or scrolling through YouTube videos and reddit posts. But if 5 points is all I walk away with, I've missed the real *point* ("So clever"). Hopefully, today I don't miss it.

For the past week or so, I've been disappointed in myself much in the way Suleika expresses. I have *so much* that I want to do. And the person I want to be seems so far away that I can barely discern them through the fog created by all of the thoughts in my head. Are they even real or realistic? With Suleika's thoughts in mind, I want to clear the fog made up by the resolutions and see what I can of my future self.

Instead of being an individual that has accomplished all of these goals / tasks / resolutions, I see they are content, driven, and focused. And in the exercise of stating those attributes, I realize I'm stating why I'm disappointed in my present self. 

I don't feel driven, focused, or content. I have so many goals (lack of focus), I don't work on them (lack of drive), and I feel I'm letting time pass me by (not content). Accomplishing my goals won't give me focus, drive, or contentment but as Suleika notes, I can't just speak them into existence either.

If I'm to believe in the value of ritual, I should ask what rituals would give me focus, drive, and contentment? I'll meditate on this as the new year begins.
