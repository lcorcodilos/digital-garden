Here's some stuff I want to read. I've actually read some of it already but of those, there's some reflection deserved. There are also some that are... lengthy and would require more focus than I may be inclined to give.

I'm also reading physical books (that will make it on here at some point with my notes) so it's not as if I don't have my reading capacity occupied by other content as well.
