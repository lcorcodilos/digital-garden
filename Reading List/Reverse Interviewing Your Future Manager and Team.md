- Core idea: Reverse interview your future team *after* you've negotiated the offer, and *before* you accept it.
	- I get the point here but part of me feels that good, hard questions are totally appropriate to ask before getting an offer
	- None of the questions are about the offer; they're about work, culture and career.
- Some good reverse interview questions the author provides:
	- _What are the last three projects you've shipped?_
	- _What is the project you're most proud of working on at `<company name>`? Why?_
	- _What is the biggest struggle you have/had at `<company name>`? Why?_
	- _What are you most excited about for the next six months?_
	- _Assuming I joined, what advice would you give to be successful?_
		- I kind of like that the presumption here is that the interviewee is in control of the decision. For the proposed post-offer timing, this makes sense but I think it feels like a small psychological trick to use pre-offer as well.
	- _Can you show a non-trivial code review?_
	- _What separates a good day from a bad day for you?_
		- 90% of the time the response will be along the lines of "a good day is when I can get something done, a bad day is when I don't".
		- Perfect! Now ask: "how often do you have bad days?" "what tends to cause them?".
- Really liked this - ask about your future manager from a future peer
	- _What do they like and dislike about their manager?_ Who would be my future manager.
	- _Who did they last promote on the team, and why?_
	- _Who left the team, and why?_
	- _How supportive are they, as a manager?_
